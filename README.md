# Widom: Test-Particle Insertion Package
This Python project provides a means of running parallelized Widom's Test Particle Insertion Method [1] on all sorts of configurations drawn from
molecular-dynamics or monte-carlo simulations. This package relies partly on MDAnalysis such that a large array of trajectory files are supported, such as GROMACS's .trr file and LAMPS's .data file.
